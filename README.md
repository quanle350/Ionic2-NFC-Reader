# Ionic2-NFC-Reader
How to read NFC tags with Ionic2 RC0. Basic usage.

In the first screen, you only have to bring near to the phone a NFC tag with at least one record in text/plain mode.
The second screen will show the the text recorded for the first position (You can have an array of string recorded... and many more things)

Studing the code, you will be able to easily change it to read some other stuff.
